SA PRO Editor John Leonard, CFA, discussed with Greystone Capital the “pound the rock” approach, how they use the “scuttlebutt” approach popularized by Philip Fisher and Peter Lynch, and why sometimes the best trade is the one you don’t make.</p> <p><strong>John Leonard, CFA:</strong> You run a long-only, concentrated fund – what qualities do you look for in a long idea?</p> <p><strong>Greystone Capital:</strong> The short answer would be that I am seeking to invest in high-quality businesses run by high-quality management teams that generate significant free cash flow and are trading at cheap valuations on an absolute and/or relative basis. There’s a lot to unpack there.</p> <p>When researching new ideas for the portfolio, I have a checklist of criteria I keep in mind, as well as certain business characteristics I love. These can include, among other things:</p> <ul> <li>Off the beaten path, uncovered by analysts, unloved</li> <li>Cheap valuation relative to intrinsic value</li> <li>Aligned and high-quality management team</li> <li>Strong downside protection via cheapness, cash flows, assets</li> <li>Significant upside, take private value, M&amp;A, asset liquidation, discount to peers despite similar growth and margin targets</li> <li>Clean balance sheet</li> <li>Long runway for growth with some favorable macro tailwinds</li> </ul> <p>Given the concentrated nature of the portfolio, I place an incredible amount of emphasis on bottom up, fundamental research, making sure I understand the key drivers of a business, unit economics, and identify all potential areas of risk that may result in a permanent loss of capital. I look first and foremost for situations deemed to be asymmetric, meaning low downside risk with a high amount of upside. Long ideas are initially filtered by a few simple but important criteria, including an easily understandable business model, a clean balance sheet, long runway for growth, discount to peers, high insider ownership, and high free cash flow yield (or path to one). These investments are difficult to find, even among small less followed companies, so I don’t place a ton of weight on checking every single box right away. If a business is unprofitable from a GAAP standpoint, for example, but all of the other criteria are present, and there seems to exist a clear path toward free cash flow generation and growth, often times, I’ll take a deeper dive into the situation. Because the above description is very hard to find especially at an attractive valuation, often times, when I initially come across a potential investment, the business looks a bit hairy or is going through some negative situation which has caused the undervaluation to exist. I think it’s important to be rigid in terms of one’s investment philosophy and what might constitute a good addition to the portfolio but also remain flexible and open-minded as there are many things that matter in business and investing that aren’t reflected in GAAP financials or my own personal checklist.</p> <p>My aim is to build an attractive portfolio of these high-quality companies that should continue to grow in value year after year. My typical portfolio at any time is made up of 6-15 high-quality companies that I have studied for an extensive period of time. I look for a combination of unique/low valuations and long-term pricing anomalies when selecting investments for the partnership.</p> <p>One of my favorite attributes involves founder-led companies (where the founder owns a significant portion of the shares) in their earlier stages (sub-$100mm market caps) with significant runways for growth, some macro tailwinds, and the ability to change or dominate a niche industry. Add in a high free cash flow yield (or path to it) and a clean balance sheet, and you’ve probably got a good long candidate for our portfolio. Partners often hear me talk about ‘micro-caps’ or small cap companies, which often times are too small to generate sell-side coverage, aren’t followed by buy-side analysts, and generally move around undiscovered until the thesis starts to prove out.</p> <p>Other things I look for include a company’s ability to dominate a niche in a large addressable market, network effects, recurring revenue, and hidden or masked cash flow generation that isn’t yet being appreciated or valued correctly by the market. Investing in under-analyzed and under-followed companies can occasionally produce an informational edge, or at the very least provide me access to things like site visits and management teams. When a small or micro-cap company fits some of the above criteria, and there is no sell-side research or analyst coverage, I definitely want to do some more digging.</p> <p>In terms of valuation, of all the valuation metrics that have been used in the past few decades, one that I use more than most involves the use of free cash flow, a metric that is difficult to fudge and provides a solid stream of real cash flow that belongs to the owners of the business at the end of each year. Looking at a company’s free cash flow yield, or the inverse, price to free cash flow, gives me a solid sense of how cheap/expensive a business is on the surface, and gives me an idea of whether or not it’s worth a deeper dive. Typically, if a company is trading at less than 10-12x free cash flow, or has a free cash flow yield in excess of 8-10%, it\\'s most likely worth taking a closer look.</p> <p>I also occasionally utilize EV/EBITDA ratios as a proxy for cash flow in order to get a measure of a business valuation or how cheap/expensive it is without taking into account each company’s capital structure, capex needs or tax rates. However, I have to admit that I don’t love using EBITDA to value public companies. It’s an ugly metric that usually doesn’t represent the true economic reality of the company’s growth, profitability, and capital intensity. So, I will focus on price to free cash flow.</p> <p>Overall, long ideas should fit the description of a quality business at a favorable price where I try to think about each investment using a multi-year time frame or holding period.</p> <p><strong>JL:</strong> As a follow-up, how do you come across these micro cap ideas? What does your idea gen process look like, since these seem like ideas that would not show up on a screen?</p> <p><strong>GC:</strong> Admittedly, this is a haphazard process. I don’t limit my search for value and, to date, haven’t found one particular or specific place to go in order to consistently generate ideas. I start with a pretty broad research or screening process, by reading a lot, things like annual reports, investor presentations, newspapers, SEC filings, fund manager letters, investing blogs, and company write-ups/analysis on places like Value Investor’s Club, SumZero, and I spend a lot of time on Seeking Alpha. The typical year will have me attempting to find 1-3 really good ideas per quarter, which usually involves combing through hundreds of businesses and reading all that I can get my hands on. I’m not one of those investors who likes to read six newspapers per day and would much rather focus on studying businesses, talking to other investors, and doing primary research. I really enjoy reading fund manager letters and investment writeups and probably read hundreds of analyses per year with a focus on trying to filter ideas for further evaluation that fit my investment strategy.</p> <p>Generating ideas via screens has never been a strength of mine, either because as you mentioned, smaller companies don’t screen well, or maybe I’m bad at filtering what I want. I also like to read the company reports, go through my research process, and spend a lot of time thinking about a business from a qualitative standpoint as opposed to picking out a few key numbers and going from there. Screens can be a bit backward looking in that sense. The quantitative side is very important, but as mentioned above, there are plenty of things that matter in the investment world that aren’t reflected in the reports or financial statements. I usually don’t attempt a valuation or look at many of the key numbers until later on in my research process. I use kind of an ‘if, then’ approach: if the business looks like X, management acts like X, and the economics are like X, and the risks are X, then how much should the business be worth?</p> <p>Lately, my best sources of ideas have been reading company write-ups, fund manager letters, and speaking to other investors about individual companies. It’s exciting when I come across a new idea or company that appears to match our investment criteria, and where I’m forced to dig into the filings or start to learn about a new industry. Given the number of publicly traded companies, including over-the-counter, I enjoy letting other smart analysts and investors ‘find’ ideas for the partnership.</p> <p>When I started out as an investor, I put an incredible amount of weight on originality of an idea. I used to think it was a sin for another fund manager to have led me in the direction of a quality business trading at a cheap valuation if I weren’t the one to ‘see it first’. This idea and behavior turned out to be harmful as I missed on a lot of companies that upon studying, I’d be thrilled to have in the portfolio. The reality is, there are tens of thousands of public companies out there, and one of me. I simply won’t be able to cover them all over time, so part of being successful as your portfolio manager is opening my mind up to new ideas and making sure I’m always collaborating with smart and talented investors. I think it just makes a ton of sense.</p> <p>In one of the best articles I’ve read about investing, Graham Duncan, professional allocator and co-founder of East Rock Capital, outlines his opinion of the five levels of the ‘game’ of investing based on decades of experience and interviews with thousands of fund managers.</p> <p>He describes level 2 as Expert, playing the game you were taught as the stage when an analyst moves from processing other people’s research agendas to generating their own ideas. It’s within this stage, he describes, that most investors plateau, where they develop a static sense of identity (such as, I am a value investor like Buffett). Duncan says that by constructing their identity as an ‘expert’ in certain sectors or companies, they limit their ability to observe change in those areas.</p> <p>It is through this lens that some investors then come to see that filtering other people’s ideas represents an ability to identify key drivers of the game. It may be easier to build a portfolio by owning ideas through analysts, as opposed to doing an investor’s own deep research on each investment idea.</p> <p>When it comes to idea generation, I am happy to let others point out undervaluations of certain companies and will always take a look under the hood, as long as the companies strictly fit my investment criteria, I am capable of understanding the businesses, and they provide an adequate margin of safety or downside protection.</p> <p>With that said, I will never purchase a security without running it through my screens, research process, valuation tests, and checklists, but where exactly the idea for that security comes from is less important to me than spotting the key drivers of a situation and seeing the underlying reality. In a universe where most companies issue millions of shares to the public, I find it strange to withhold from investing in a quality business at a favorable price just because I didn’t ‘find it first’.</p> <p>As Duncan says: “Pride of authorship is an obstacle when it comes to making money.”</p> <p>Every new idea starts with bottom up, fundamental research, seeking to determine a specific company\\'s ability to generate financial returns and whose price or value today is disconnected from our estimate of those returns in the future. I then try to apply a conservative valuation based on my knowledge of assets, earning power, industry conditions, competitive position.</p> <p>Right now, I have a watchlist of 150 companies or so that I monitor and read about often. I’ll follow the quarterly reports and read the conference calls, read the news flow, and occasionally do some back of the napkin valuation math. These are companies that have passed my initial filter or have some intriguing characteristics but maybe I felt that the price wasn’t quite where I wanted, or I needed to see management execute more before diving in. Clearly, these aren’t all going to be buys, and I’ll be lucky if 10 of them eventually qualify for further research, but for now, any significant price drops catch my attention.</p> <p><strong>JL:</strong> Active managers are facing more competition than ever (not just from other active managers but from passive, quants, etc.)- how have you been able to differentiate Greystone?</p> <p><strong>GC:</strong> The idea behind Greystone was to form an investment partnership that is differentiated from most asset management firms or mutual funds, which includes being able to invest where larger funds can’t, placing a cap on assets, and forming interests that are always aligned with those of my limited partners.</p> <p>Decades ago, the investing environment looked like this; during the era of the 1950s and 1960s, markets were wildly inefficient, most people didn’t read company 10Ks or 10Qs, and that generation of investors, having lived through the great depression, were incredibly skeptical of stocks and viewed them as vehicles for speculation and pieces of paper, not shares of real businesses with real products/services/assets. There was no electronic information, no email, and no computers. So, to the person who looked, they could actually find things that were trading for less than the cash on their books. You could find businesses that were horribly misunderstood. You had a real research or informational based edge. Fast forward to today, and there are 8,000 books (via an Amazon search) about value investing. There are hundreds and hundreds of websites, blogs, and publications about value investing. Information is widely disseminated, and that same research-based edge seems to be gone.</p> <p>A tiny bit of that edge still exists among the top managers (with access to CEOs, top level info, etc.), but in my opinion, today, there are only a few types of edge you can have in the market:</p> <ul> <li>You can obviously have a research based or information edge, which as described, is mostly gone based on Reg FD and competition.</li> <li>You can have an analytical edge or analytical advantage which is the type of edge where you have the same information as everyone else but you process it differently, in a way that is superior. This type of edge still exists.</li> <li>You can have a structural edge – this means you’re able to hold things for a very long time. When you have an LP base that is willing to stomach through all of those years of volatility, you’re allowed to play offense when others are playing defense.</li> </ul> <p>In addition, competition has become incredibly intense at a time when the number of publicly traded companies has dwindled from M&amp;A, companies staying private, public companies going out of business, etc.</p> <p>With all that doom and gloom, where does that leave Greystone? I won’t shy away from labeling myself as a concentrated value investor, with a rather large focus on buying high-quality companies with a very large margin of safety. I feel as though I have found a sustainable place for ideas in the small and micro-cap universe of companies, where there are less analysts, no published research, illiquidity, restrictions on the type of fund that can own them, and misconceptions about the value. Such companies can almost appear ‘invisible’ to Wall Street given their size, providing ample time to evaluate the business models, get familiar with the management teams, and accumulate shares before they are ‘discovered’ by the rest of the market. Our research process is based on our desire to own companies for multiple years, not quarters, and focuses on company-specific drivers of value as opposed to variables that govern the major stock market indexes. Greystone’s investment strategy seeks to capitalize on the need for most money managers to achieve short-term and relative-return based results. This short-term focus can create long-term price inefficiencies in many securities, because for most investment managers and institutional money, positive business catalysts or outcomes many years into the future have no use today, or next quarter.</p> <p>I think Greystone’s characteristics, which include being small, willing to invest where others aren’t (or can’t), taking a long-term view (decades and not quarters or years), and aligning my interests with those of my limited partners has helped set us apart from many larger investment vehicles and mutual funds. In addition, I’ve been blessed with an incredible base of limited partners that include people who understand what we are trying to do, have internalized our investment philosophy, and share the same long-term views as I do about investing. I think it was Seth Klarman who said something like \"your success has a lot to do with your client base\" (I’m butchering that probably), and I feel I have a phenomenal group of partners that has without a doubt helped Greystone become what it is today.</p> <p>Outperforming the market over a long period of time is incredibly difficult, and while our concentrated, small and micro-cap investment strategy will no doubt produce down years, especially during periods of large cap growth and bull markets, I feel that over a period of years, not months, we will do better than average in terms of our return profile.</p> <p>Lastly, it’s worth noting that I am disciplined enough to hold cash in the absence of compelling investment candidates, which many larger investment funds could never do. In addition, I’m fairly committed to maintaining a modest level of AUM that allows me to optimally execute my strategy, focusing as it does in micro and small cap securities. Large pools of capital seem to be highly correlated with diminishing returns, and I have no interest in being faced with such a problem.</p> <p><strong>JL:</strong> What is the “pound the rock” approach? What are some specific and actionable ways investors can implement this in their investment decision-making process or careers?</p> <p><strong>GC:</strong> This idea of pounding the rock comes from my background in sports, where I worked for a period of time in basketball operations with the San Antonio Spurs, whose team motto revolves around this phrase, which is the title of a poem by photographer Jacob Riis. Pound the Rock Investing is the name of my blog, and in essence, the poem describes the impact that modest but consistent effort can have over long periods of time. The Spurs as a team and organization embodied this philosophy day in and day out, and the ideas of patience, continuous improvement, building a sustainable culture piece by piece and getting better at your craft every day have been large contributors to the incredible success they’ve experienced over the past few decades.</p> <p>So, how does that tie into investing? Well, I think in line with relating other disciplines to the art of investing, having a sense of history is one of the most important things an investor can possess. History, among other things helps develop perspective, understanding, and a sense that it takes an incredible amount of time to do anything worthwhile. That last idea applies to compound interest in a huge way.</p> <p>It’s no secret that in order to be a successful active manager or stock picker, one has to develop a continuous learning mindset, or as Charlie Munger would call it – become a learning machine. Some refer to this as the ‘snowball effect’, most famously coined by Buffett (and the title of one of his biographies), meaning the idea that small bits of constant learning and development can have outsized positive effects over time. I think outside of the value investing circle, this concept can be appreciated as it relates to personal development as well.</p> <p>In order to improve at anything, one needs to practice. However, time constraints and the potential frustration that comes with slow progress is enough to dissuade many people from attempting at all. However, even small amounts of effort can have a significant impact over time. The power of consistent gradual improvements over time, or, pounding the rock, can be enormous.</p> <p>This ‘pound the rock’ approach to learning is part of why I’m excited to get out of bed in the morning, and the reason why I continually strive to seek out new information about companies, industries, and investing. It’s also why I try to broaden my horizons in other disciplines and fields such as psychology, social dynamics, economics, decision making and history. Investing is very much a multi-disciplinary field where information builds upon itself, and having a broad swath of levers to pull when searching for answers or doing analysis can prove beneficial in ways you wouldn’t necessarily expect. Most days, advancements in knowledge are too small to grasp, but the Spurs opened my eyes to the idea that small days of improvement will eventually combine to form meaningful progress. My goal has been to position myself to be able to take advantage of that progress, and it’s been my promise to all of my LPs since the inception of Greystone that I will continue to do so going forward and pound the rock one blow at a time.</p> <p><strong>JL:</strong> Can you talk about how sometimes the best trade is the one you don’t make?</p> <p><strong>GC:</strong> I think this idea really gets at the importance of having a disciplined investment philosophy and sticking to that philosophy through up and down markets, and various stages of the business cycle. Running a concentrated portfolio means that much less of my time will be spent trading or buying/selling stocks, as opposed to studying businesses/industries, and trying to figure out if a certain company would fit in the portfolio. I have a decent understanding of my own behavior as an investor, as well as what I’m capable of understanding, so there are plenty of industries I avoid, and as mentioned above, most businesses don’t fit my investment strategy or within my narrow criteria for further evaluation. I think I’ve avoided a lot of mistakes this way, as I’m not concerned with being the smartest guy in the room, but rather focused on my process, continuing to make good decisions, and knowing when something falls outside my realm of understanding. Now that I think of it, I know I’ve missed some winners using this approach, but I’ve also avoided permanent losses of capital in some situations.</p> <p>In my early investing days, my mission was to ‘find and buy cheap stocks’, obsessed with sometimes short-term returns, quantitative factors and never paying above a fixed price (15 P/E or 10x EV/EBITDA) for anything. That’s probably true for a lot of early value investors. We equate value with cheap. I know I was anchored to that idea. I view that mentality now as hurtful to performance, given that I totally ignored the future prospects of a company. I was paying more attention to price paid and much less attention to the characteristics that made up a quality business, such as high returns on incremental invested capital, long runways for growth, dominant market position, cash flow generation, and solid management teams that know how to allocate capital.</p> <p>Thankfully, I’m a fast learner, because man is there a difference between cheap and a bargain. I can point out plenty of cheap companies statistically where there is a very good chance the equity ends up at zero, or investors experience a negative return over time. I’m no longer interested in those types of businesses. It wasn’t too long ago that I probably shifted away from deep value investing or Ben Graham style of ‘getting excited to buy super-cheap assets and just sitting on them for years waiting for the market to catch up’, to more of a Buffett style of investing where I’d like to get a great price but also a great company. There are differences of course, the main one being that I don’t own these companies like Warren Buffett does. But in line with that thought, I try to look at buying shares of a company as if I was buying the entire business. Would I want to commit capital to this industry? This management team? This capital allocation track record? I want the downside to be protected by hard assets and cash flows. If that isn’t the case, it’s a pretty simple way to eliminate most investment ideas. I’ve made my fair share of mistakes and will most likely continue to do so, but I take some comfort in knowing that probably 99% of my time is spent not buying anything or not evaluating businesses within industries or sectors I have a difficult time understanding.</p> <p><strong>JL:</strong> How do you use the “scuttlebutt” approach popularized by Philip Fisher and Peter Lynch? Can you give an example?</p> <p><strong>GC:</strong> Scuttlebutt is something many investors are familiar with by now, given the age of Phil Fisher and Peter Lynch’s books, yet it’s an approach that I still haven’t seen adopted by a lot of fund managers or active investors. Scuttlebutt refers to the idea of doing primary research about a company, outside of what is publicly available through the internet or SEC filings. For Greystone, scuttlebutt has consisted of simply trying to gain more insight into a business by speaking with/visiting management teams, talking to customers, using a product or service, or visiting headquarters. Over the years, I’ve seen arguments against doing these things including the desire to avoid behavioral biases such as the halo effect, but utilizing this approach has been nothing but beneficial for me as an investor. Primary research is time consuming, difficult, and there have certainly been times when I’ve walked away from a visit or conversation with nothing material, but for those exact reasons – not everyone is willing to do it – scuttlebutt will continue to play a big role in how I research a business.</p> <p>I think things like speaking with management teams, visiting company headquarters, speaking with stakeholders and/or customers, employees, and suppliers has been one of the most important parts of my investment process. For technical businesses especially, site visits make a ton of sense, and investors are able to get a real glimpse into what they’ve already read by stepping into a factory or onto a company property or seeing a sales force in action at a tradeshow etc. It’s one thing to read about the capex needs of a business or sales and marketing spend, but a completely different thing to see things up close (that’s what they spend x amount on per year, and this is why sales and marketing is so important etc.).</p> <p>I believe taking the scuttlebutt approach is invaluable in terms of the insight gained and being able to paint a real picture of a business outside of reading the publicly available reports. Of course, not every business is worth visiting – plenty of software companies are made up of buildings and cubicles – and it’s not always possible for some given budget and time constraints, but there are other ways to peel back the layers of a business on the phone or by doing research online. Sites like LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and various others have provided a ton of transparency from the standpoint of employees, and you can at least get a glimpse into what a certain company’s culture looks like.</p> <p>Trying to develop an understanding of a business – which is a complex system – requires seeing things through eyes that aren’t your own, and being able to adapt when there are red flags or the opposite, you see something that may serve as a key competitive advantage or differentiator, yet can’t be found in the company’s filings.</p> <p>You don’t learn everything you need to know by doing this, but I believe it’s a nice piece of the overall pie that will continue to be an important part of my research process moving forward.</p> <p><strong>JL:</strong> What’s one of your highest conviction ideas right now?</p> <p><strong>GC:</strong> Good timing here, as I just <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4187449-select-sands-corp-mining-value?source=pro_newsletter_interview\">published a piece</a> on Seeking Alpha about Select Sands Corp. (SLSDF), a micro-cap frac-sand producer that is firing on all cylinders, and ramping their way toward a 1mm ton yearly run rate in an environment with some secular tailwinds that include plenty of demand and a favorable pricing environment. Although most publicly traded frac sand producers appear to be in the penalty box at the time being, Select trades at a discount to peers, will be highly cash flow generative over the next 12-18 months, and appears to be the low cost producer in terms of cost per ton to ship sand given their favorable geographic location to the major basins in Texas.</p> <p>The frac-sand business isn’t great, given the commodity risk associated with owning some of these names, and has been typically characterized as cyclical, requiring lots of capex, no pricing power, and subject to supply/demand metrics. It’s still that way, but I don’t mind taking on some commodity risk, given Select’s long runway for growth, clean balance sheet, experienced management team and path toward a high free cash flow yield. Select fits many of the criteria I look for when evaluating a business and appears very undervalued in a market that seems rather expensive.</p> <p>For Q1 2018, Select was able to ship nearly 100k/tons of sand, generating $832k in EBITDA, on the back of some transportation and logistics bottlenecks, and flooding issues at one of their mining facilities. The company is ramping toward shipping 1mm tons/year and has made some operational changes in terms of facility consolidation that should end up saving them a few dollars per ton in logistics costs or COGS, their biggest expense. On the way toward a 1mm ton run rate, I see the business being able to generate somewhere in the neighborhood of $9-11mm in EBITDA by 2019, with little additional capital, no M&amp;A, and the purchase of no new facilities. The entire business is being valued by the market at around a $35mm EV. That’s cheap, even for frac sand producers.</p> <p>Bears may point to sand oversupply, increase in the use of Permian or ‘in-basin’ sand, and industry debt loads, but I feel that Select’s valuation doesn’t price in any positive developments (that the business is making) and ignores the debt/EBITDA of less than 1x on the company’s balance sheet.</p> <p>Applying a conservative 5x multiple to $10mm in EBITDA for 2019, backing out net debt of $4mm gets us to an EV of $46mm. Dividing by 97.5mm shares gets us to a share price of $0.47, or a nearly 50% premium to today’s prices. I think we will experience much better results, but that back of the napkin exercise points to the low end of my valuation. Add in the solid management team, and low levels of debt, and I’m more than willing to be patient here.</p> <p>I also feel very good about The Joint Corp. (JYNT), which is an investment that was pointed out to me while reading a fund manager letter outlining the simple but powerful thesis.</p> <p>The Joint is a $110mm chiropractic services business operating a retail/franchise format across the U.S. and experiencing rapid growth and customer adoption over the past few years. The Joint is attempting to revolutionize chiropractic care by developing a cash-based, no appointment type of chiropractic model with average pricing at a fraction of a traditional chiropractic visit. When I started researching the business, it was clear the market wasn’t giving the company any credit for many of the positive developments that were taking place, but that seems to have changed a bit recently. Shares are up some 50% in a short period of time, but I believe the company still has plenty of room to run, with a long runway for growth and a patient, experienced management team who has executed brilliantly since taking over in 2016.</p> <p>The Joint builds and manages chiropractic clinics throughout the US through direct ownership, management arrangements, franchising and the sale of regional developer rights. They provide chiropractic care in a \\'retail\\' like format (shops next to grocery stores etc.) where they charge for single visits, membership fees, and also receives royalties from gross sales for each new franchise opened.</p> <p>What attracted me to the business was the simple, convenient, affordable care provided to the nearly 40 million adults who seek chiropractic treatment. The Joint solves a real problem by providing patients with a private pay, cash-based model that requires short site visits and no appointments, all at a price lower than most competitors pricing for similar services.</p> <p>Americans spend around $90 billion on back pain each year, of which $15 billion is dedicated to chiropractic services (and oddly enough, back pain is tough to diagnose, and is still just called \\'back pain\\' in most doctor\\'s offices). What originally peaked my interest was the decline in the share price from a 2016 high of around $12 to below $5.00/share when I came across the company. During the ramp-up of the company\\'s growth, the former management team was a bit too aggressive with their expansion targets, aiming to double the number of clinics being opened each year. That\\'s 100% growth every year. With ambitions like that, you\\'re going to run into some hiccups, which is exactly what happened. Following an announcement of reduced clinic growth and a large cash burn, shares were hammered pretty hard. Shares currently trade at below the IPO price, despite during this same time period, the company has grown their clinic footprint, slowed the cash burn, shuttered unprofitable stores, and same store sales growth (the growth of stores that are already open) is in the double digits. Yet, in my opinion, the company is still undervalued.</p> <p>The Joint has grown rapidly in both system wide sales and opening of new clinics, going from 8 clinics in 2010 to 400 as of last month. The expansion hasn’t been without hiccups (described above) however, and the company has since slowed their growth expectations to 40-50 new franchised clinic openings per year (still 20% growth per year) and halted company owned store acquisitions, in order to preserve cash and systematically grow the business in a sustainable way. The company now has a far-out target of 1400 clinics in the U.S., and the potential to experiment with their model overseas moving forward.</p> <p>Both company owned and franchised units are a key part of the company’s strategic objectives moving forward. Increased sales from both models results in high operating leverage by clustering clinics and lowering operational and marketing costs. Franchise model generates predictable, recurring revenue from royalties and licensing fees.</p> <p>Unit economics for company-owned clinics are attractive, with the average clinic turning cash flow positive within 12-18 months and generating EBITDA margins in the neighborhood of 25-35%.</p> <p>We now have a new CEO in place with 30 years of small-box franchise experience, and the company is majority owned by a group of patient investors (John Leonesio, the founder of Massage Envy and a number of other franchises across the US, owns 6% of the company). In addition, the rapid growth in the demand for chiropractic care across the US, the asset light, recurring revenue nature of the model, and the potential operating leverage as new clinics are built and old ones mature, provide for a really attractive set up to step in front of. The company just reached GAAP profitability, which provided an additional boost to the share price.</p> <p>I\\'ve been able to speak to management, employees, and customers, as well as read hundreds of reviews via Yelp, Glassdoor and various other forums. The company seems to be loved by customers and employees alike, and the ‘spa-like’ setting of the clinics feels much more intimate and relaxing than a typical doctor-office adjustment. The industry is highly fragmented as well, with nearly 40,000 providers of chiropractic care across the U.S., and with the top 5 providers contributing to less than 10% of industry revenues. Aside from two competitors who operate just 12 clinics with a model similar to JYNT, nobody is operating at the scale of the company, or attempting to copy its model (yet).</p> <p>I see the company eventually being able to reach conservative EBITDA of $8-10mm and free cash flow targets of around $6-8mm by 2020, at which point we feel the business has the ability to generate a greater than 10% free cash flow yield and continued operating leverage (despite growth, SG&amp;A has remained flat or declined each of the last 6 quarters).</p> <p>Our margin of safety lies in the positive industry tailwinds, solid management team in place, long runway for growth, and clean balance sheet with no net debt. Mature franchise businesses with much smaller growth rates trade at around 13-16x EV/EBITDA. JYNT’s strong balance sheet and experienced management make us comfortable holding for the long term.</p> <p>In keeping with our philosophy of investing when things ‘just don’t make sense’, this was a company that fit the bill in terms of high-quality businesses with clean balance sheets run by experienced management teams who are aligned with shareholders.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Thanks to Greystone Capital for the interview.
